## Methods
  - API
  - Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
  - Correlation
  - Visualization
  - Export Data
  
## Libraries 
  - Python
  - Fredapi
  - Pandas
  - Numpy
  - Datetime
  - Sklearn.preprocessing
  - Matplotlib
  - Plotly.express
  - Seaborn
    
## Tools
  - Google Colab
  
## Steps
  - On the website https://research.stlouisfed.org/ I researched and identified the data that could help me discover the variation of which index most affects real state prices in the United States.
  - I filtered the S&P 500 data to convert daily to monthly information so I could compare this index to other indexes.
  - I used MinMaxScaler to normalize the data and merge to have all information in the same dataframe.

## Conclusion
  In the last 10 years the evolution of the U.S. National Home Price Index (CSUSHPINSA) was very similar to the variation of the S&P500 index (500 large companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States). The correlation with the Median Consumer Price Index (MEDCPIM158SFRBCLE) also is hight.
