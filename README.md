  - Seaborn
    
## Tools
  - Google Colab
  - Jupyter
  
## Steps
  - On the website https://research.stlouisfed.org/ I researched and identified the data that could help me discover the variation of which index most affects real state prices in the United States.
  - I filtered the S&P 500 data to convert daily to monthly information so I could compare this index to other indexes.
  - I used MinMaxScaler to normalize the data and merge to have all information in the same dataframe.

## Conclusion
  In the last 10 years, the index that showed the greatest correlation with House Prices was the S&P500.
